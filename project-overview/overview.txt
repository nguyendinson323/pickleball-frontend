As a web dev, I am going to complete a project from a client.
# here is some sentencese extracted from the conversation between us.
<>
Developing the association's website, including registering players, clubs, leagues, tournaments, grouping them by state, player rankings, etc.

can you make a site as good as the ones you mentioned as part of your resume?

ok so i am looking for a very complete application like the ones you showed me

but i dont know if its to large for one person

as i want this done quite fast
how long would it take to develop all that

https://courtreserve.com/pickleball

my excel only contains the basic, but i will like to add ways to monetise
like having a site that handles courts etc like courtserve.com
also having the leagues tournaments etc tht you have in your sites
i guess your sites are complete
so thats what we have to discuss what to keep what to add
and consider i need to add league, clubs, players rankings, tournaments, etc and i want to make the courtreserve to monetize
of course i consider your porposal an estimate
and we can adjust latter
so dont worry much about that now i want something outstanding, i am a developer myself started in 1991
also will need NDA from you and intelectual property rights of whatever we do

Hi Azlan, I wanted to ask if you have any kind of diagram or schema for how the ranking system will function. Specifically, will the points be assigned automatically through the tournament system you're developing, or will the tournament results need to be manually entered into the system through an admin panel?

Hi, great question. I’m thinking the ranking system to support both options for flexibility,

Hi Azlan, I wanted to ask if you have any kind of diagram or schema for how the ranking system will function. Specifically, will the points be assigned automatically through the tournament system you're developing, or will the tournament results need to be manually entered into the system through an admin panel?

I don't consider it necessary; what I wanted to know was whether we would have the ability to modify the point values assigned to each tournament depending on the needs of each one

It’s also important that not all tournaments contribute points to the ranking system, since there will be events where most participants are foreigners or they are exhibition tournaments.

I also wanted to share a table with you so you can keep it in mind—it's a rough outline of how we plan to manage the point allocation system for winners, depending on each player's level of play. I'm not sure if it works similarly to what you have planned.

What I wanted you to keep in mind for now is that there will be 6 categories or skill levels, meaning the 2.5 players are the least skilled, and the 5+ players are the professional ones (this is represented by the green bar at the top of the chart)

On the left side are the types of tournaments, and the value in front of each one is the number of points the winner of that tournament will receive.

What I wanted to know is whether the system you’re planning to develop works in a similar way or if it’s even better—so I can decide whether to base the project on your system or have you develop it entirely according to each client’s specific needs

Regarding the structure you’re currently working on, I’d like to add a functionality that is very important for us.
This feature allows all athletes who register on the platform to find nearby players to play with—either people in their same area or state, or even when they travel to another state, they can find players in that location.
The system should send a notification (via text message and email) to the person interested in playing, once the system finds a nearby match, and notify both players.(important)

I’m going to share this page with you so you can review it and see how this functionality works.
It also allows athletes to find coaches near them, for those who want to learn how to play pickleball

https://www.playyourcourt.com/tennis-community

I’ve been researching the development of this functionality, and in some cases it requires API integration with Google, which can generate a cost per use.
We would like to know if there’s any method to implement it without incurring costs, and if not, then we’ll need to consider that this feature will have a cost—or that it could be included as part of a premium feature package for players

# Project Overview – Pickleball Sports Federation

<>
The project you are collaborating on is the official digital platform for a national sports federation dedicated to the development and regulation of Pickleball. This federation is responsible for organizing and promoting the sport at a national level, establishing official standards, and serving as the central authority for players, clubs, tournaments, and regional associations.

What is a Sports Federation?

A sports federation is a governing body that oversees the promotion, regulation, and development of a specific sport within a country or region. Federations are typically recognized by national or international institutions and act as the primary authority for organizing competitions and setting rules for the sport.

Main Functions of a Sports Federation:

• Regulation and Governance: Establish official rules, standards, and guidelines for fair play and competition.
• Athlete Registration: Maintain official records of players, rankings, and categories by age or skill level. The platform will also generate digital credentials for each registered athlete, which will serve as their official 
identification within the federation. These credentials can be used to verify their status during tournaments, training sessions, and other official events.
• Club and Association Management: Recognize and coordinate regional associations, clubs, and institutions affiliated with the sport.
• Event Organization: Oversee local, state, and national tournaments and championships.
• Ranking System: Define a transparent point-based ranking system to evaluate and classify players.
• Training and Certification: Promote training programs and certify coaches, referees, and officials.
• Promotion of the Sport: Support outreach campaigns, educational initiatives, and community engagement to grow the sport.
• Representation: Act as the official representative of the sport before public institutions, sponsors, and the international community.
• Official Store: Operate an official federation store that offers high-quality, authorized Pickleball gear and accessories in collaboration with top international brands. The store not only promotes the sport, but also helps fund federation activities and national events.

Additional Services – Monetization Layer

Beyond its core regulatory role, the federation will also offer a second layer of paid services through the platform. These services are designed to enhance the experience for clubs and players, and to generate sustainable income for the federation. Key features include:
• Tournament Management System: Clubs will be able to organize and manage tournaments directly within the platform, with tools for player registration, brackets, results, and rankings.
• Court Management System: Clubs can define their available courts, schedules, and allow players to reserve courts through a user-friendly interface.
• Player Finder: A social tool that allows registered players to find other players in their area or in the city/state they are traveling to, based on level, availability, or location—encouraging more active participation and community engagement.

This monetization layer will be optional, offered under a freemium or subscription￾based model, and will be key in supporting the federation's long-term sustainability.

# Pickleball Platform – Complete Specifications for Profiles and Forms
<>
The federation is composed of various roles structured in a pyramid-like system, organized as follows:
The federation is structured in the following way:
Players represent the base level of the federation. They are individuals who play pickleball and seek to practice the sport, reserve courts, participate in tournaments, and attend events. To be part of the federation, players must pay an annual membership fee.
There is a feature that allows them to find other players nearby, especially because there are not many players in Mexico, and some come from other countries looking to connect with local players. For them, we offer the ability to find nearby players — this feature comes at an additional cost.
Players affiliate with clubs (although they can also affiliate directly with the federation).
Most of their communication is with the State, who is responsible for organizing and overseeing the sport across an entire state.
Coaches are individuals who train other players. They will be able to pay their membership fee and also access certifications from the platform that help improve their credentials.
Clubs are groups of players who join together to play as a team or simply to ensure they always have someone to play with. Some clubs have courts and organize tournaments and events on them. Others do not; they are simply organized groups under a shared identity.
Clubs on a basic plan only receive affiliation status, which requires an annual fee.
For clubs that have courts, we offer a premium plan that enables them to:
• Create and manage tournaments directly from the platform.
• Register their courts in the system so others can view and reserve them.
• Rent out courts, allowing them to generate revenue.
Clubs that do not have courts or organize tournaments only participate in events organized by partners or affiliates.
Partners (such as hotels, resorts, camps, private companies, and court owners) are entities or individuals who own courts or organize events and tournaments, with the sole purpose of generating income. There is no affiliation fee for partners — only a premium plan.
The premium plan allows partners to:
• Create and manage tournaments from the platform.
• Register their courts in the system so others can view and reserve them.
States are the second most important entity after the federation. They are responsible for organizing, managing, leading, and promoting pickleball within an entire state (a state is equivalent to a “prefecture” in Japan — 都道府県 todōfuken). Mexico has 32 such states.
States must pay an annual affiliation fee to register (there is no premium plan here due to the higher cost of affiliation).
They have access to a dashboard that allows them to:
• View the full list of partners, coaches, and courts.
• Create tournaments and organize events.
• Administer all activities within the state.
• View the list of players registered in their state.
• Send announcements to partners and players within their jurisdiction.
The Federation has access to all functionalities. It serves as the top-level administrative entity with full capabilities, including the organization of national tournaments and the management of the entire platform.

<>
and I have finished a first version. and here is client's feedback:
<>
When I logged out from the administrator profile, this came up — shouldn’t it be redirected to the homepage?
Regarding the player search feature, we believe it’s necessary to add a function that allows players to enable or disable the option to be found in the database, for privacy reasons.
In other words, from their profile they should be able to toggle a button that says “Can Be Found” / “Not Visible”, along with a note or explanation stating that if they activate this button, they will not appear in the player search results.
This is intended for cases where, for example, some people do not wish to be found by other players and prefer to keep their personal information restricted.For those who do wish to be visible, we could make it so that in the player search results, a simplified list of information is displayed so other players can contact them.
ADMIN DASHBOARD
1. In the admin dashboard, the messaging inbox for sending announcements to clubs, players, and state committees is missing. Remember this part is important (I assume you haven’t implemented this yet since it doesn’t appear in any of the other profiles either).
2. While player affiliations can be viewed, this feature is not yet fully developed. 
It’s important to also view separately the affiliations of clubs, state committees, coaches, etc., from which a CSV report can be generated to see how many are active, how many have not renewed, how many haven’t participated in tournaments, and other relevant data.
3. There should also be a tab for everything related to rankings — player position changes and the ability to control the ranking system in case of any errors.
4. A tab is missing for managing the microsites of state committees and clubs, where it should be possible at least to supervise and modify the content of each one.
o Include an option to deactivate microsites or remove inappropriate content.
5. The court management button is not actually used by the admin account since the federation does not own courts. If we ever did, we would create an associate profile to upload the courts. Instead, this court management function should be used to monitor the activity and performance of courts uploaded by clubs or associates.
6. It’s necessary to add a tab for the management and editing of club microsites. 
It should be possible to supervise and modify visible content on the microsites of clubs and partners.
Also, remember to implement the part I already sent you about each player being required to upload a personal ID, along with some other small suggestions regarding users.
This part: Regarding the login forms: 
Also, the system must verify that the username is not already in the database to avoid conflicts, or the system could generate a username for them. 
Alternatively, we could use the CURP as the username, which would save us all the extra steps, since the CURP is a unique, unrepeatable identification key for each person. I’ll leave it to your discretion to choose whichever is easiest for you. 
2. There is no mechanism to upload a personal photo with the ability to center and crop it (similar to Facebook). 
3. There must be a mechanism to allow the user to upload a scanned copy of their official ID in PDF, PNG, or JPG format. 
5. Remember that at the end there should be a checkbox that the user must accept, which displays the privacy notice or allows them to download it. I will send you the document.
I noticed that when you enter the player profile, it allows you to upload a photo. However, we would like this to be done during the profile creation process, because some people forget to upload their photo, and since there are many players, it later becomes a problem to keep reminding them to do so.
Either upload the document so they can download it, or simply paste the text on a page so they can view it — I’ll leave that up to whatever is easiest for you. Just remember that there must be a checkbox for them to accept it during the profile creation process.
Player
1. In the player section, remember there should be a tab to display the player’s digital credential, a simplified version of their registration information (the information that should appear there is in the second document I sent you — it must include a QR code and other elements).
Coach
2.- Regarding this section, I really liked your proposal for supervision elements, scheduling training sessions, training plans, and other features. I also want to take this opportunity to commend you for making these decisions on your own based on the needs of each profile (we’ve noticed this), and this is very helpful for us because we want to build a complete platform that is useful to all role types involved in practicing this sport.
For this profile, I would only add the feature to display the match history in which they served as a referee, so it appears in their career or work record.
The goal is that from within the same platform, when someone organizes a tournament, they can select a referee from a list of referees available in the platform. This would help us track how many events they have participated in and how active they have been. Likewise, in each tournament’s information, players would be able to see who the referee will be.
Club
3.-Regarding the court rental section, I’m not sure how far along you are with it, so I’ll share my opinion based on the assumption that you may already have some plans in place that you haven’t yet completed.
For this section, we would like to see that when selecting a court, it displays a calendar, and when entering a specific day, you can view the time slots during which that court is already reserved. This should be presented in a very visual way so players can easily see which slots are available.
Naturally, this section should also have its own menu to manage invoices, payments, and generate reports on court usage.
Also remember that clubs can organize tournaments, so add a tab or button for them to organize their tournaments. This tournament section should also include options to manage their invoices, expenses, and generate a profit report for an organized tournament.
Likewise, add the section for configuring their club microsite, where they can display their information, logos, courts, banners, tournaments, etc.
4.-. State or “State Committee”
This section looks quite complete; you just need to advance a bit more in the functionalities so we can see how each feature works.
As with clubs, it is also missing the part for managing the state committee microsite, where they can display their information, logos, courts, banners, tournaments, etc.
The only thing I didn’t see is the ability to create or manage tournaments. This part is very important because they organize tournaments throughout the entire state or region.
