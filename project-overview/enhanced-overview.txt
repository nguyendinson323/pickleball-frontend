Pickleball Platform – Complete Specifications for Profiles and Forms
The federation is composed of various roles structured in a pyramid-like system, organized as follows:
The federation is structured in the following way:
Players represent the base level of the federation. They are individuals who play pickleball and seek to practice the sport, reserve courts, participate in tournaments, and attend events. To be part of the federation, players must pay an annual membership fee.
There is a feature that allows them to find other players nearby, especially because there are not many players in Mexico, and some come from other countries looking to connect with local players. For them, we offer the ability to find nearby players — this feature comes at an additional cost.
Players affiliate with clubs (although they can also affiliate directly with the federation).
Most of their communication is with the State, who is responsible for organizing and overseeing the sport across an entire state.
Coaches are individuals who train other players. They will be able to pay their membership fee and also access certifications from the platform that help improve their credentials.
Clubs are groups of players who join together to play as a team or simply to ensure they always have someone to play with. Some clubs have courts and organize tournaments and events on them. Others do not; they are simply organized groups under a shared identity.
Clubs on a basic plan only receive affiliation status, which requires an annual fee.
For clubs that have courts, we offer a premium plan that enables them to:
• Create and manage tournaments directly from the platform.
• Register their courts in the system so others can view and reserve them.
• Rent out courts, allowing them to generate revenue.
Clubs that do not have courts or organize tournaments only participate in events organized by partners or affiliates.
Partners (such as hotels, resorts, camps, private companies, and court owners) are entities or individuals who own courts or organize events and tournaments, with the sole purpose of generating income. There is no affiliation fee for partners — only a premium plan.
The premium plan allows partners to:
• Create and manage tournaments from the platform.
• Register their courts in the system so others can view and reserve them.
States are the second most important entity after the federation. They are responsible for organizing, managing, leading, and promoting pickleball within an entire state (a state is equivalent to a “prefecture” in Japan — 都道府県 todōfuken). Mexico has 32 such states.
States must pay an annual affiliation fee to register (there is no premium plan here due to the higher cost of affiliation).
They have access to a dashboard that allows them to:
• View the full list of partners, coaches, and courts.
• Create tournaments and organize events.
• Administer all activities within the state.
• View the list of players registered in their state.
• Send announcements to partners and players within their jurisdiction.
The Federation has access to all functionalities. It serves as the top-level administrative entity with full capabilities, including the organization of national tournaments and the management of the entire platform.
