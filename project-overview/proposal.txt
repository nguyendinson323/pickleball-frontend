Here’s a proposal draft based on my client’s conversation, structured to reflect clarity, flexibility, and professionalism:

Project Proposal – Racquet Sports Association Platform

Hi, thanks for outlining my vision. Based on our discussion, here’s a preliminary breakdown of the project scope, structure, and timeline.

 🎯 Project Goal

Develop a professional-grade platform for racquet sports associations that includes player, club, and tournament management, court reservations (inspired by CourtReserve), player rankings, state-based grouping, and monetization options.

 🧱 Proposed MVP Features

To deliver fast and iteratively, I suggest launching with an MVP (Minimum Viable Product), then expanding.

 Core MVP Scope

 Player registration & profiles
 Club and league registration
 Tournament & league management (basic brackets, schedules)
 State-based grouping and filtering
 Player rankings (manual or auto-scoring logic)
 Admin dashboard with full CRUD
 Basic monetization setup (e.g. Stripe/PayPal integration for tournament or club fees)

 Stretch Features (Phase 2+)

 Advanced court reservation system (like CourtReserve)
 Player availability & scheduling
 Paid membership tiers
 Auto-matching or ladder leagues
 Real-time updates / notifications
 Advanced analytics for clubs/tournaments

 ⏱️ Estimated Timeline

 MVP build: 4–6 weeks (depending on final scope freeze)
 Full system (with reservation + monetization): 8–10 weeks total

(We can shorten this by narrowing down features in Phase 1.)

 💼 Tech Stack

Modern stack using:

 Frontend: React & vite & tailwindcss & react-redux
 Backend: Node.js
 DB: PostgreSQL
 Payments: Stripe integration

 🔄 Next Steps

 Define which features are MVP vs. later phases.
 Decide backend tech stack and monetization model.
 Sign NDA and begin UI/UX wireframes or database schema.
