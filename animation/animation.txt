Here‚Äôs a **smooth-animation strategy** for your Pickleball Federation landing page that keeps it visually engaging without hurting performance:

---

### üéØ **Animation Strategy (Performance-Optimized)**

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Use GPU-Friendly Properties**

* Animate only:

  * `transform` (translate, scale, rotate)
  * `opacity`
* Avoid:

  * `top`, `left`, `width`, `height`, `box-shadow` (cause reflow/repaint)

---

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Strategic Animation Placement**

* **Hero Section**:

  * Fade-in + slight slide-up for heading & call-to-action button.
  * Delay 0.2s between each element for a ‚Äúcascade‚Äù effect.
* **Event Cards**:

  * Subtle hover scale (1.02) with shadow for interaction feedback.
* **Membership Plans**:

  * Flip-in or fade-up when scrolled into view.
* **Testimonials**:

  * Crossfade between quotes every 6‚Äì8 seconds.

---

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Trigger Animations on Scroll**

* Use **Intersection Observer API** instead of constantly checking `scroll` events.
* Only animate elements once when they enter the viewport.

---

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Keep Duration Short**

* **Entrance animations**: 300‚Äì500ms
* **Hover effects**: 150‚Äì250ms
* Avoid anything over 1s unless it‚Äôs a slideshow.

---

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Lightweight Animation Libraries**

* **GSAP** (GreenSock) ‚Äî highly optimized, can batch animations.
* **Framer Motion** (if React) ‚Äî easy for complex UI animations.
* **Animate.css** ‚Äî good for quick fade/slide effects.

---

#### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Mobile Optimization**

* Reduce animation complexity on mobile (less simultaneous movement).
* Use `prefers-reduced-motion` media query for accessibility.

I hope to use animation effect for every div, img, h1~h6, p, input and button tags.
and in one screen, the animation style should differ for every tag.
I don't like animation delay effect.
don't use any Libraries for animation. I like to use TailwindCSS with raw css.
you can create a perfect index.css file and use it for every page frequently
