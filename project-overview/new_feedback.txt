I have been reviewing your progress and yes, you have indeed made good progress regarding the structure of the website. We could say that you have successfully developed the “boxes” where each function should go.

However, we have noticed that there hasn’t yet been significant progress on the key functionalities that we need on this site.

We would like you to make progress on the site’s key functionalities since these represent the true utility of the platform we want to develop.

but it still lacks any of the core features we are truly interested in, such as the court reservation platform, tournament creation platform, player search system within the same area with notifications, or the digital ID card.
